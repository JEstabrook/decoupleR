\title{This function takes the result from viper
and prepares the data frame for roc/pr curve analysis. For each TF-experiment
combination a response and a predictor value is generated.}
\usage{
prepare_for_roc(df, filter_tn = F, ranked = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{run_method_viper() output}

\item{filter_tn}{logical flag indicating if unnecessary true negatives should
be filtered out (unnecessary means that there are no true positives for a
given tf)}

\item{ranked}{logical flag indicating if input is derived from composite
ranking that already took up-/downregulation (sign) into account}
}
\value{
tidy data frame with meta information for each experiment and the
response and the predictor value which are required for roc curve analysis
}
