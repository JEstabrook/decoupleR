# Files for unit testing

Here we will store input and output files for our unit tests via [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org). Due to their file size we won't track their version's on GitHub. Instead they will be distributed and managed via Google drive. 

The files are accessible [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JR88_2W9vQONJ1x8Hx0WLoF4OtIXkVL7).
