# Files for unit testing via [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org)

Here we will store input and output files for our unit tests. Due to their file size we won't track their version's on GitHub. Instead they will be distributed and managed via Google drive. 

The files are accessible [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JR88_2W9vQONJ1x8Hx0WLoF4OtIXkVL7).
